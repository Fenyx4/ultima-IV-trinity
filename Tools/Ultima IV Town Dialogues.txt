Ultima IV town script

Version 2.0.0 copyright 2000 Andrew Schultz(schultza@earthlink.net)

Ultima IV is copyright Origin 1987.  This script is not endorsed by 
Origin in any way.  This script is part of my efforts to preserve the 
memory of certain great classic Apple games.  Although the algorithm to 
reproduce the scripts from disk images/data files is not terribly 
complex, this document took some effort to produce, so please do not 
reproduce it for profit without my prior consent.

Oh, U-4-ria!  This script contains information on pretty much everything 
an NPC can say.  There is a basic format for meeting them, as follows:

You see [description.]  [sex] says:  my name is [name].

You can ask anyone in Brittania about his name, job, and health.  In 
addition, each person has two things they will talk about.  After the 
first one, they ask no questions, but they may ask a question after the 
second one.  If so, you may answer yes or no, and they will answer 
differently based on that.  So, in the first example, ask Joshua for 
HELP and he will say "The riddle!"  Ask Joshua for RIDDLE and he will 
tell the first part and ask "More?"  Note that any response or query of 
"A" in this script means that the NPC has nothing else to say.

This script is intended as reference--it's most useful for searching for 
a specific item, i.e. "Rune" or "Compassion" or "Skull."  It has the 
NPC's sorted by town name.  All conversations are in CAPS because that 
is how they were in the file, and I didn't quite have the time for an 
algorithm to change that.  Maybe later.

Enjoy, and send any comments, positive or negative, to 
schultza@earthlink.net.

This can accompany my beginning-of-game questions and FAQ/walkthrough 
proper.

Census Results
****

Well, since the US's Census 2000 has just passed, it's time for a truly 
senseless census.  Introducing the Census of Britannia for Ultima IV!

The population of Britannia is difficult to determine exactly, even with 
knowledge of all standard dialogs.  Lord British and Hawkwind, for 
instance, do not turn up there.  Neither do innkeepers.  However, an 
initial inspection(GREP this file on UNIX) shows the talkative 
population of Britannia breaks down as follows:

BY SEX
Male:  176
Female:  55
Neuter:  24 (This includes ankhs, horses, ghosts, skeletons, and a bull-
-I may categorize these later given the time.  The game refers to them 
as "it.")
Child:  1 (This child's sex was indeterminate.  "It" lives in Britain.)
Total:  256

BY PROFESSION
This includes the main eight professions of Britannia.  The totals do 
not sum to 258, as there are beggars, children, and guards.  In the 
future, the number of guards will be tabulated--there is more than one 
guard per town, but each talks the same.  This count includes potential 
PC's.

This is an initial pass at the census, because it is not always clear 
from the text who is what.  When I walk through the game again, this 
will be sharpened.

Mage:  17
Bard:  9
Fighter:  14
Druid:  15
Tinker:  6.  "Dan the Tinker Man" is possibly a tinker.  This will need 
further investigation.  Census officials are still proofreading this!  
It's taking longer than a US election to decide, too!
Paladin:  8
Ranger:  15
Shepherd:  14
Total:  98
  OTHER PROFESSIONS:
Jester:  7
Beggar:  8
  JUST PLAIN OTHER:
Viper:  1
Orc:  1
Troll:  1
Reaper:  1
Boy:  2
Girl:  2 (+Sue?)
To be tabulated:  ordinary people, children and other miscellany.

overall.  11/23/2000

Credits: http://www.kahei.com is a HEX editor that helped me determine 
which bytes went where.
http://www.moongates.com is a WONDERFUL site that I didn't discover 
until after I'd done my first draft of this script. It's interactive and 
also helped me determine initially that Allan was in Cove and not 
Vesper. In a way, they do everything I do and more, but this plain e-
text version may be a quicker reference, and besides, parsing the file 
was a small personal project of mine.
