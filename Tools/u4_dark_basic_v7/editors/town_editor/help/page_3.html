        (background) merchants in U4 exist as special NPC's who do NOT talk like
        normal NPC's, therefore have no talk id, but are identified by merchant
        id#'s. You can have up to 255 merchant id's (U4 has about 65 total!) All
        merchant</font></h1>
        <h1 align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">id's are stored in
        MERCHANT.OVL. See over right to examine a real weapon vendor. The id is
        23 and the type of establishment is Weapons. The owner is Winston, who
        runs Windsor Weaponry. He sells a Stave for 20, Dagger for 2, Sling for
        25 and Sword for 300. The 'X' are just nulls (blanks/unused). The good
        part is you do not need to edit this with notepad to create your own,
        the <u> town-editor.exe</u> will do it for you! I have taken great pains to
        eliminate this tedious task because a simple error will cause all sorts

      create items and enchant stuff for a fee. For example, talking to this
      merchant, he will greet you and then ask what stuff you want to give him
      to create an item. These item &quot;recipes&quot; are found in 'recipes.ini'.
      You choose from your inventory, and if a correct combination exists, the
      newly item is created. A example -
      <p>mix 1 part Cookie Sheet and 1 part Bread Dough = 5 Rations</p>
      <p>Editable items:<br>
      The owner's name, shop's name and the description are editable<br>
      i.e. (&quot;Just the best in Tinkering!&quot;). The price per item created
      is also user adjustable. In this case, 35gp per 5 Rations.</p>
