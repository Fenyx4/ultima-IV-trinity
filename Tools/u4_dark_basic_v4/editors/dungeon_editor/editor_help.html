<p>Welcome to Dungeon_Editor ver 1.2.1.8</p>
<p>This program assists the game designer to build levels that eventually are
displayed in real 3D. The editor has many features integrates<br>
This is a work in progress, so updates/feature enhancement will occur rapidly.<br>
Email me for features desired.</p>
<p>When you start the editor, a splash screen will display. Hit spacebar to
continue.<br>
The editor will then prompt for you to select an existing dungeon file (*.DNG)
and will display all 8 levels at once.<br>
Shortly an isometric 3D preview will be seen. You can then select a ICON from
the available ones (30 in all)<br>
Once that icon is selected,&nbsp; the editor lets you know the name and picture
of it. Paint the tile onto an existing level by simply<br>
left clicking onto one of the 64 (8x8) grids. The 3D display will automatically
update.<br>
<br>
If you wish to create a new dungeon, then select the green menu item that
displays &quot;Create a New Dungeon&quot; Type the new filename<br>
without any dng suffix. The program adds that later. Your blank level will load
shortly and gets created in the directory.<br>
You may either SAVE, CLEAR all levels or QUIT at any point. Quitting does NOT
save your work.</p>
<p>If you wish to load another dungeon, then select that one anytime. The
correct dungeon loads and the active level displayed in 3D is level 1.<br>
To select another level (make sure HALLWAY icon is selected) click on any black
hallway grid on any level to make that one active. The 3D<br>
will auto update as usual. You can edit any level at once, and the 3D preview
will be correct.</p>
<p>3<u>D Preview</u></p>
<p>This added functionality is there to let you preview the level in a pretty
close to realistic mode as possible. Note there's no collision<br>
built in now will there ever be. You start off with Fog Off and the camera is
displayed over the level. If you want to hover over the level<br>
then use the arrow keys to move. Hit the &quot;-&quot; key to &quot;go
into&quot; the level and see a more realistic view. Hit 'F&quot; to create a
foggy and dark<br>
dungeon like environment similar to the remake. Hit 'F&quot; to toggle
Fog/ambient light on/off.</p>
<p><u>Known issues -&nbsp;</u></p>
<p>The 3D preview only displays Doors, Corridors and Walls. Future updates will
have ladders etc... I do not believe I will add other stuff<br>
like fountains, orbs because this is simply a preview to check navigation in 3D.</p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">The actual U4 format is designed as a 8x8 matrix - so why are there 14x14
grids in the 3D view?</font></b><br>
I decided to expand the 8x8 to 14x14 so it will overlap and flow better. Ever
see the dungeon maps on the internet?<br>
You will find everyone NOT display maps in 8x8. This is used in the remake, but
the only difference is that during navigation<br>
whenever you get to a edge of a level you don't see blue sky but you are
&quot;teleported&quot; to the first tile across so it all looks seamless and<br>
depending on how smartly you do this, an 8x8 simple design can be very hard to
find your way out or be made very easy.</p>
<p><i>I am not aware of any bugs in the editor at this point. I am sure someone
will point out a quirk or two. I have included the source code<br>
but it will be of use to those who do darkbasic pro programming. This program
took me 2 days to write however, I tried to make it as polished<br>
as possible.</i></p>
<p>Changes from the original U4 regarding mystic altars. In this game colored
stones can be found in Altars in Dungeons. When you place a red stone<br>
in a level grid, that automatically becomes a searchable altar. Stones can also
be placed in world (on surface WORLD) and in towns!<br>
<br>
Remember you need all 8 stones, the candle, book and bell. Those cannot be found
in dungeons except the colored stones.</p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Is this remake's dungeon files compatible with the
original game?<br>
</font></b>In short yes and no. I believe they will play to some extent, but I
did change a few subtle things like the $hex values for stones vs. altars in U4.<br>
There will be more &quot;bytes&quot; used in my game so if the file loads into
U4.exe then you're doing well. It was never meant to go the other way. Also, I
did not implement those &quot;rooms&quot; between levels - that I found idiotic
that they programmed that in. You can however edit original U4 files and they
will be updated in the editor and made playable.</p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">How does one incorporate custom dungeons</font></b><font color="#FF0000"><b>
in the remake?<br>
</b></font>Here's the answer -&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to file dungeon_links.ini<br>
<br>
- contents of file - <br>
<i>**This holds the locations of all dungeons **<br>
SRC_area&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

027,156<br>
:Prepare Avatar,:evil lurks within:these depths!:</i>
<br>
- end of contents -<br>
<br>
To link Covetous (COVETOUS.DNG) map to britania, you need to specify the
following data:<br>
First line - WORLD defines that starting place is Britania (refered to as WORLD)<br>
Next is the actual *.dng file to link (type exact filename). You can even
specify a unique MIDI file<br>
to play.coordinates where dungeon is located - format yyy,xxx, followed by
coordinates avatar<br>
goes to upon dungeon exit (format yyy,xxx,). Then a simple 1 line message. IF
you want to<br>
specify a CR (new line) then use the COLON ':' formatter. For example <br>
:Prepare Avatar,:evil lurks within:these depths!:<br>
will display as:<br>
<b>Prepare Avatar,<br>
evil lurks within<br>
these depths!</b><br>
Then finish with a blank line of &quot;*&quot; - just copy/paste<br>
and 'eof' must be present at the end of the file to delimit an end of file
marker.</p>
