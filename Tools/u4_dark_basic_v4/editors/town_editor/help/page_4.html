      will CLONE this by clicking COPY CURRENT ENTRY. You are then asked a
      index# (19-255) but try 100 for now since that's not used. Now you will
      see a copy of winstons weapons for editing at index 100.&nbsp;This number
      is also the NPC'id when assigned to a NPC 
      <p>By clicking on the various items, you can change the name, some items
      and prices for example as seen here. To write these changes permanently, click on
      UPDATE MERCHANT.OVL&nbsp; If
      you do not want this entry, click on DELETE CURRENT ENTRY.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If you want to assign this to the merchant we created, click on ASSIGN
      TO MERCHANT NPC.</p>
      <p>Change this NPC's location to 4,14 so he resides within his shop, then
      make sure he tracks/follows player.Click on UPDATE then select FILE/UPDATE
      (*.ult) to save all changes.</p>
      <p>To add Lord British or Seer Hawkind, just select those. Lord British is
      always npc_id =17 and the seer=18</p>
      <p>Merchants start at 19-255.</p>
      <p>To delete the last NPC, click on NPC/Delete this/Delete Current NPC.
      The last NPC used is the one deleted. Click on any NPC then delete.</p>
      <p>Tip - You can have many many merchants per town, up to 32 in fact and
      they all could be Weapon merchants if you wish. They can all share the
      SAME merchant id's, but that's a bit extreme.</p>
      <p>Tip - NPC-Id = Merchant-Id (19 to 255)</td>

<p>Lastly, try to create a GUILD merchant and a few other NPC's by applying what
you've learned already. Simple eh?</p>
