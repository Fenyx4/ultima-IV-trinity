<p>We now see this NON talking guard. Click on tile start and replace with 136
and 137 with tile end. Also change the y pos to 24 and x pos to 4</p>
<p>Then hit update. Now a sea creature should be present at the river. All non
talking monsters/NPC's have&nbsp; npc_id's of 0</p>
<p>Now we will create a normal talking NPC guard. Click NPC/ADD/Add NPC. You
should see a NPC appear at 1,1</p>
<p>Left click on this NPC to pull up his stats window. Change his y pos and x
pos to 9,12 respectively and tile start and end 80,81. Click&nbsp; on </p>
<p>update and he should appear right below the entrance to the 'weapons' shop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><img border="0" src="npc_1.gif" width="416" height="644"></td>
    <td width="50%">You will see your changes appear now. You can also see what
      this guard says when talked to - job, name health look etc...
      <p>He will say &quot;I fight bravely&quot; if asked about WARR (warrior)
      and also say &quot;Plenty of ORCS up North&quot; when asked about ORCS.</p>
      <p>He will ask a question when Keyword1 (WARR) is mentioned. He will ask
      &quot;Are you Brave?&quot; - you reply /y/ - he replies &quot;Good!&quot;
      or /n/, he replies &quot;Coward!&quot;</p>
      <p>That's how the dialog works. If you click on KEYWORD1, you get a prompt
      asking you for a new input. If you select JOB then whenever you ask his
      JOB, he will ask that question. IMPORTANT - KEYWORD1 and KEYWORD2 MUST BE <b>4</b>
      CHARACTERS LONG!!</p>
      <p>Click on MOTIONLESS, and you can make this guard follow you, attack you
      (pointless if a talking NPC) or wander around. etc...</p>
      <p>Click on UPDATE to make changes. These changes ONLY are for real when
      you click on FILE/UPDATE (*.ult)</p>
      <p>Since you can have 16 NPC's like this and another 16 non talking NPC
      you can see we have made 2 so far. Let's create another guard like him - a
      clone so to speak.</p>
      <p>Repeat what you did to create this guard exactly, but place him at
      position&nbsp; 9,15. He will stay close to the other guard. Let's check
      his speech. If you left click on him, you will see the generic speech
      again, so if you want to create the SAME speech as the first guard, assign
      that speech code to him. Click on COPY ANOTHER TLK and a new window
      appears with ALL available speeches. You should have 2 available. Select
      the first guards speech - should be 1 (move slider) When you find the
      speech, you can select it by clicking on USE THIS TALK. Note - either edit
      speeches in this window or in the talk selection window. In the previous
      window, hit UPDATE TEXT to make it stick.</td>
