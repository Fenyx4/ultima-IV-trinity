I01.
The day is warm, yet there is a cooling breeze. The latest in a series
of personal crises seems insurmountable. You are being pulled apart
in all directions.

I01.
Yet this afternoon walk in the country-side slowly brings relaxation
to your harried mind. The soil and strain of modern high-tech living
begins to wash off in layers. That willow tree near the stream
looks comfortable and inviting.
I01.
The buzz of dragonflies and the whisper of the willow's swaying branches
bring a deep peace. Searching inward for tranquility and happiness,
you close your eyes.

I02.
A high-pitched cascading sound like crystal wind-chimes impinges on
your floating awareness. As you open your eyes, you see a shimmering
blueness rise from the ground. The sound seems to be emanating from
from this glowing portal.
I02.
It is difficult to look at the blueness. Light seems to bend and
distort around it, while the sound waves become so intense,
they appear to become visible.

I02.
The portal hangs there for a moment; then, with the rush
of an imploding vacuum, it sinks into the ground.
Something remains suspended in mid-air for a moment before falling
to earth with a heavy thud.
I03.
Somewhat shaken by this vision, you rise to your feet to investigate.
A crude circle of stones surrounds the spot where the portal appeared.
There is something in the grass.

I03.
You pick up the amulet shaped like a cross with a loop at the top.
It is an ankh, the sacred symbol of life and rebirth, but this could
not have made the thud, so you look again and find a large book
wrapped in thick cloth.
I03.
With trembling hands you unwrap the book. Behold, the cloth is a map,
and within lies not one book, but two. The map is of a land strange
to you, and the style speaks of ancient cartography.

I03.
The script on the cover of the first book is arcane but readable.
The title is:       The History of Britannia
                           as told by
                         Kyle the Younger
I03.
The other book is disturbing to look at. Its small cover appears
to be fashioned out of some sort of leathery hide, but from what
creature is uncertain. The reddish-black skin radiates an intense aura
suggestive of ancient power.
I02.
The tongue of the title is beyond your ken. You dare not open the book
and disturb whatever sleeps within. You decide the peruse the History.
Settling back under the willow tree, you open the book.

I02.

                    (You read the Book of History)


I02.

                (No, really! Read the Book of History)


I02.
Closing the book, you again pick up the ankh. As you hold it, you begin
to hear a hauntingly familiar, lute-like sound wafting over a nearby
hill. Still clutching the strange artifacts, you rise unbidden and climb
the slope.
I04.
In the valley below you see what appears to be a fair. It seems strange
that you came that way earlier and noticed nothing. As you mull this
over, your feet carry you down towards the site.

I04.
This is no ordinary traveling carnival, but a Renaissance Fair.
The pennants on the tent tops blow briskly in the late afternoon
breeze.

I05.
The ticket taker at the RenFair's gate starts to ask you for money,
but upon spotting your ankh says,
'Welcome, friend enter in peace and find your path.'

I05.
The music continues to pull you forward amongst the merchants and
vendors. Glimpses of fabulous treasures can be seen in some of the
shadowy booths.

I05.
These people are very happy. They seem to glow with an inner light.
Some look up as you pass and smile, but you cannot stop -  the music
compels you to move onward through the crowd.

I06.
Through the gathering dusk you see a secluded gypsy wagon sitting
off in the woods. The music seems to emanate from the wagon.
As you draw near, a woman's voice weaves into the music, saying:
'You may approach 'o seeker.'
I07.
You enter to find an old gypsy sitting in a small curtained room.
She wears an Ankh around her neck. In front of her is a round table
covered in deep green velvet. The room smells so heavily of incense
that you feel dizzy.
I07.
Seeing the Ankh, the ancient gypsy smiles and warns you never to
part with it. 'We have been waiting such a long time but at last
you have come. Sit here and I shall read the path of your future.'

I08.
Upon the table she places a curious wooden object like an abacus but
without beads. In her hands she holds eight unusual cards.
'Let us begin the casting.'

closing_remark#1
With the final choice, the incense swells up around you. The gyspy speaks
as if from a great distance, her voice growing fainter with each word:
'So be it! Thy path is chosen!'

closing_remark#2
There is a moment of intense, wrenching vertigo. As you open your eyes,
a voice whispers within your mind, 'Seek the counsel of thy sovereign.'
After a moment, the spinning subsides, and you open your eyes to...
