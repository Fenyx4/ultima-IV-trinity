<PRE>Honestly, I tried to make this as easy as possible, and all custom content is within the available *.ini files
provided in the /u4_maps directory. The ini files come pre-documented in most cases and you must refer to the help in them
or here before attempting to modify them. Note that a simple mistake will render the game un-playable. Back up
files before attempting to create new areas.

<a name="Can I add custom tiles and graphics?">Can I add custom tiles and graphics?</a>

Yes, by replacing the tilesets and intro graphics you can add your own. Some graphics are jpg and some png.
Try to keep size down for these as game will run faster.</PRE>

<PRE>This file holds the starting graphic parameters. My default settings are shown here. Changing from one

To link Covetous (COVETOUS.DNG) map to britania, you need to specify the following data:
First line - WORLD defines that starting place is Britania (refered to as WORLD)
Next is the actual *.dng file to link (type exact filename). You can even specify a unique MIDI file
to play.coordinates where dungeon is located - format yyy,xxx, followed by coordinates avatar
goes to upon dungeon exit (format yyy,xxx,). Then a simple 1 line message. IF you want to
specify a CR (new line) then use the COLON ':' formatter. For example 
:Prepare Avatar,:evil lurks within:these depths!:
will display as
Prepare Avatar,
evil lurks within
these depths!
Then finish with a blank line of &quot;*&quot; - just copy/paste
and 'eof' must be present at the end of the file to delimit an end of file marker.

<a name="How do I make custom towns, villages and castles link to the game?">How do I make custom towns, villages and castles link to the game?
</a>
In order to link a *.ULT (town file) to the WORLD, you must be familiar with the file 'links.ini'</PRE>
<PRE>Here's an EXCERPT from links.ini</PRE>
<PRE><i>WORLD
106,082
Britain
Towns.mid
BRITAIN.ULT
015,000
TOWN
106,082</i></PRE>
<PRE>When the First Line = &quot;WORLD&quot; means this town file (*.ult) is linked to the main map &quot;WORLD&quot;.
The Second line corresponds to the coordinates in the WORLD where this town is found.
The Third line is the name you assign to this town. 
The Fourth line is the custom midi (sound) file played when entering this town.
The Fifth line is the actual file name (*.ult) to link
The Sixth line is the coordinates you start when you enter this place.
The Seventh line is the type of place. Possible values are &quot;TOWN&quot;, &quot;VILLAGE&quot;, or &quot;CASTLE&quot;
It makes no difference whether you put a &quot;CASTLE&quot; as opposed to a &quot;TOWN&quot;. It's just for the player.
The LAST line corresponds to the coordinates you go upon exiting this place back in the WORLD.
</PRE>
<PRE>Another type of link can be within a &quot;CASTLE&quot; or &quot;TOWN&quot; or &quot;VILLAGE&quot; and this would mean like climbing/descending
a ladder to go up/down a level. In U4 these levels are actually just another map to load. Let's look at how one goes
and links ladders up/down in LORD British's castle. TOWNS (or any area) CAN ALSO have many levels like CASTLES.</PRE>
<PRE><i>WORLD                  &lt;-----you must be here first
107,086                &lt;-----where this link is
LORD BRITISH LVL.I     &lt;-----assign any label to describe this area
Rule_Britannia.mid     &lt;-----music played when entering this area

031,015                &lt;----where you goto when entering this area

107,086                &lt;----These are exit coords when leaving area</i></PRE>
<PRE>This would mean when in the WORLD, pressing the 'E' key to enter this place would load in 'LCB_1.ULT' which is
Lord B's castle - level 1. Etry coordinates are 031,015, and exit coords are 107,086.</PRE>
<PRE>There's a LADDER at coord. 003,003, and when you hit /d/escend to go down, this part is then exectuted- </PRE>
<PRE><i>LCB_1.ULT              &lt;-----you must be here first
003,003                &lt;-----where this link is (ladder)
LORD BRITISH LVL.II    &lt;-----assign any label to describe this area
Rule_Britannia.mid     &lt;-----music played when entering this area
LCB_2.ULT              &lt;-----this is where you are going to
003,003     &lt;----where you goto when entering level 2
CASTLE      &lt;----Place descriptor
107,086     &lt;----These are exit coords when leaving area</i></PRE>
<PRE>So here the game would load 'LCB_2.ULT' (second level) and start you off at 003,003 (same as before - unless you plan
on teleporting somewhere!), then 'Rule_Britannia.mid'plays.</PRE>
<PRE>After exploring this area <i>LCB_2.ULT</i>, you come across another ladder at 003,003 (<i>LCB_2.ULT)</i>, so what link get's
executed?
Simple, the one shown below  -  See below - </PRE>
<PRE><i>LCB_2.ULT         &lt;-----you must be here first

CASTLE
107,086</i></PRE>
<PRE>See, here we are currently in 'LCB_2.ULT' so hit /k/limb to go up, we end up loading 'LCB_1.ULT' and zoning

This is how fixed spawns are initialised. The number of spawns is between 01 and 99 i.e  - this number corresponds to
the number of custom spawns within this file.
The next 2 lines define the starting positions - yyy,xxx
Then the actual monster name is stated. The various name options are found in file 'spawns.txt' (read only!)
Do not modify that file, just refer to it's contents.
Pull out the difficulty - easy, medium or hard are referenced. Not all monsters are found in all 3 difficulty 
areas, so you must use exactly what's provided.

<PRE>Within this directory is a GREAT utility &quot;EBoN 3.3&quot; by Sami Pyorre to create unique names for your creations. It is
very comprehensive and can generate thousands of names by genre.

<PRE>What this is all about is the user can quest for items and then when a recipe is known, go to a Tinker Merchant
and have him/her create special items for you for a small fee. It's also possible to use the newly created item
to be used in part of another recipe to create another item - and so on. Please note the SPELLING MUST be identical
to the inventory item. There's a limit of 64 UNIQUE items one can have, although you can create infinite item types.</PRE>
<PRE>See the file 'recipes.ini'</PRE>

<PRE>Here the goal is to create a Enchanted Key. First required is Iron Ore, Iron Bit Mold, Gold Ore, and upon paying the Tinker
you get Golden Ore. Then with the Golden Ore, you add a Magical Parchment, a Key, and finally you create an Enchanted Key.
So this Enchanted Key could be used in the game to enter a special area like a dungeon, town or castle.</PRE>
<PRE>Custom RESERVED ITEMS currently are:

RATIONS
Enchanted Armour
Mystic Armour
Mystic Weapon
Enchanted Weapon</PRE>
<PRE>When you create RATIONS with above recipe, you get 5 food, but the RATIONS are deleted
from the inventory as are your items to create it. Creating Enchanted Weapon (aka Mystic Weapon)
and Enchanted Armour (aka Mystic Armour) also yield an item and the bits required to fabricate these
disappear from inventory. For you reference, Mystic Armour and Enchanted Armour are exactly the same item
as are Mystic Weapon and Enchanted Weapon. Spelling MUST be exactly like seen here (case sensitive).</PRE>

the Whirlpool?</a></p>
<p>See the file 'whirlpool.ini'</p>

<p>- end of contents -</p>
<p>The Whirpool is self maintaining once initial coordinate are set. Whenever
you save/load game, the current whirlpool location is saved and this<br>
file gets overwritten. Therefore the whirlpool loads in its position every time
after a save/load. The whirlpool exists only over water and when a frigate
navigates over one, player gets teleported to the destination coordinates,
anywhere in the WORLD.</p>

this is where you will start. Save Game overwrites this file.</p>

<br>
</a>Simply put, when meditating at a shrine for either 1,2,3 cycles, the
appropriate message is displayed. Here is an excerpt from the<br>
file 'shrines.ini' for just the Compassion text - Note the <b>':'</b> imbedded
in the text is used as a carriage return (CR) in the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="How does one submit custom modules?">How does one submit custom
modules?<br>
<br>
</a>This is pretty easy - Anything in the directory /u4_maps/ <i>(but <b>not</b>
u4_maps/save) </i>should be made into a *.zip and emailed to&nbsp;<br>
me. I will unzip, place into /u4_maps/ directory and check out the files.
Naturally, you can include the u4_maps/save directory<br>
if you are including a current save game. If you are downloading a custom
module, you do the same but always backup your&nbsp;<br>
previous u4_maps/ files first.</p>
<p>You can download and upload just the *.tlk (talk files) and *.ult (town
files) and incorporate them into a new / existing module.</p>
