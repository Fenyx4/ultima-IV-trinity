Dragons are in the Trinity code now, but I am not 100% sure of whether or not they can stay. The finally tidying up of the mod might need a few lines of code here and there, and the current Dragons code has left me only a few bits of space.
The dragons are also really fun to ride, and meet a number of goals I had for starting the mod in the first place, which was mainly to reduce some of the late game annoyances, as I saw them, such as non-stop battles and endless travel. 
I don't mind these things early on, but later in the game it would be nice to be able to cross the distances undisturbed, as would befit the strength and presence of a true Avatar.
So, I have taken the Dragon code and made it into its own, stand-alone mini-mod. 

Ultima IV: Dragon

You can find the mod itself via the link below.

I hope someone might enjoy it.
