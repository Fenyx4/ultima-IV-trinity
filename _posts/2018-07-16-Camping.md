So, my little ones were playing Ultima IV (vanilla), sailing across the open seas, in search of adventure. A couple of the lead adventurers were feeling a little worse for wear. Something a little 'Holing up and Camping' would solve in a trice. But they were at sea!

Well, one of little ones had the brilliant idea to exit the ship, then Hole up and Camp. So they exited the ship.

Then they Holed up and Camped. What the....!?!?

Where did this little patch of land come from in the middle of the ocean? Where's our ship? What is going on here?

Well, my little ones, despite their youth and inexperience in such things, immediately thought this was a 'bug' in the game. I was hard pressed to deny this self-evident truth. At minimum it could be thought of an an oversight, or an omission, on the part of the original coders.

So I've fixed this 'issue' now. Exiting a ship, in the ocean, and camping will bring up the following:

</figure>

Further, camping while in the ship is possible too. So, I guess this is a cross between a bug fix and an improvement.
